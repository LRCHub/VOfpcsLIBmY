[00:11.52] Okay okay hahaha
[00:13.60] Tiny but mighty, say, baby
[00:15.61] So watch me glow, oh
[00:17.81] Set trends that you think are crazy (the craziest, the craziest)
[00:21.73] Everything that you know will be changing (you'll like it, you'll love it)
[00:25.89] Lookin' so sharp like she's a diamond shine (oh yeah)
[00:29.00] Signing in pink, her autograph's one of a kind

[01:00.51] Busy taking over... (Hello?)
[01:02.60] Absolute focus... (All the way!)

[01:06.68] Who cares, who cares about those boring rules
[01:08.67] This round is mine, I'm the winner!

[02:02.08] 
[01:48.64] In the quiet, I tell myself
[01:53.11] Not to be swept away from all the noise outside my mind
[01:58.36] Then it starts melting away, every last negative
[02:02.40] Making the room I need for all of the positives
[02:06.48] Then I believe the world is mine to shine bright
[02:10.43] Not scared of danger, fight it away just for you
[02:14.11] Cause someday, you will see me
[02:16.72] The way I see me
[02:18.79] Behind the glitter and the love you gave me
[02:40.29] 
[02:23.93] Like me, whatchu like in me
[02:25.58] Busy making the whole world my own
[02:27.66] Like me, whatchu like in me
